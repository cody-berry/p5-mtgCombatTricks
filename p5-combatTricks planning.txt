Planning
Setup: Loading the cards
    1) Load the cards from Scryfall. You should have a ScryfallAPI project.
    2) Print all the cards' names.
    3) Print all the cards' types. 
Setup: Card filtering
    1) With each cards' types, filter out only the instants.
    2) Check for Flash in keywords.
Setup: Other
    1) Load all mana symbols
    2) Initialize Color classes for each color, including colorless
Mana: Representing
    1) Whenever you press 'c', 'w', 'u', 'b', 'r', 'g', say 'add {color}...'
    2) Whenever you press the keys earlier with shift, say 'remove {color}...'
    3) Create a Color class.
    Classes: Color
        1) Constructor: Initializes color, color name, and color symbol.
        Non-Constructor Functions: draw()
            1) Draw a box based on the x and y position of this object.
            2) If number_of_times_selected is at least 1, color the box.
            3) Draw the color symbol inside the box, coloring as shown in 2).
            4) Draw bars equal to number_of_times_selected.
        Non-Constructor Functions: increment()
            1) Increment number_of_times_selected.
        Non-Constructor Functions: decrement()
            1) Decrement number_of_times_selected if it is above 0.
    4) Whenever you press one of the keys in step 1, increment {color}.
    5) Whenever you press one of the keys in step 2, decrement {color}.
Cards: Cost filtering
    1) If the CMC of the card is <= the # mana you have, add it to canidites.
Cards: Can you cast this?
    1) For every canidite, remove all brackets from its mana cost.
    2) Remove all numbers and Xs.
    3) For every color, if 1st is <= the second: you can cast this.
        1) The # times that color appears
        2) The number of times you have appended the color
More: keyPressed
    1) If you press Z, show all the canidites and use all included in Cards.
More: Extensions
    1) Hybrid mana on both sides
    2) Extra mana-related artifacts like Energy Refractor
    3) Special instants and flash cards like Machine Over Matter
