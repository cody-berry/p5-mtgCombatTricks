Here's what I think the p5-mtgCombatTricks plan should be:
Display 6 circles, one for colorless, another for white, another for blue, and so on.
Make an Icon class. The class should have one of each:
    - Color
    - If it should be highlighted or not (later transform into stacks of mana)
    - Later: SVG image
    - Radius of icon circle
    - Position
    - First letter of mana color
Create a function called 'show()' in Icon. It shows a circle with color 'Color' and with radius 'Radius of icon circle' with position 'Position'.
You can do these in either order:
    Enable highlights and key presses.
        Create a function called 'select', which:
            Sets 'If Icon should be highlighted or not' to true as long as 'First letter of mana color' is equal to the string argument.
        Create a function called 'deselect', which:
            Sets 'If Icon should be highlighted or not' to false as long as 'First letter of mana color' is equal to the string argument.
        Let lowercaseKey equal the lowercase of the key typed.
        If that lowercase key is in the list ['c', 'w', 'u', 'b', 'r', 'g'], then:
            if the lowercase key equals the actual key (in value), then:
                We call select on all icons with an argument of the key pressed.
            Otherwise:
                We call deselect on all icons with an argument of lowercaseKey.

        Make it so that in Icon.show():
            We fill with the color at 80% opacity if 'if it should be highlighted or not' is true, otherwise we fill with the designated color at 50% opacity.
    Figure out how to use svg and display it properly.
        Research svg and display the svg on each icon in their show() with a tint/fill/whatever of black.
Play around with the colors of the circles. Make them not pastel-ish.
Transform 'if it should be highlighted or not' into 'stacks of mana'. 'if it should be highlighted or not' can be calculated by:
    if 'stacks of mana' is greater than 0.
Iterate from 0 to mana_stacks and draw a bar at each of them with a height of a predefined constant, and with a spacing of a predefined constant. From what I hear, the formula is: i*(BAR_HEIGHT + BAR_PADDING) - BAR_PADDING/2. Draw a diagram if this doesn't work. Even if it does, reason through it.



To figure out what cards are combat tricks:
    - Check 'keywords'. If it includes flash, it's a combat trick.
    - Check the type line. If it says 'Instant', it's a combat trick.
To figure out whether we can cast something:
    Set 'can we play this card' to true.
    For each combat trick:
        - Check the non-bracket non-number letters in the mana cost (not converted).
        - If we don't have that color, set 'can we play this card' to false.
