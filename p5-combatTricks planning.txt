Here's what I think p5-combatTricks's plan should be:
Display 6 circles, one for colorless, another for white, another for blue, and so on.
Make the icon class. The class should have one of each:
    - Color
    - If it should be highlighted or not (later transform into stacks_of_mana)
    - Later: SVG image
    - Maybe radius of icon circle?
    - Maybe mana color?
You can do these in either order:
Enable highlights and keypresses.
Figure out how to use svg and display it properly.
